\section{Introduction}

In the tech era, \textit{Big Data} offers great promise: to fuel innovation, 
generate new revenue streams, and transform society. Along with heightened 
expectations about about the potential big data is a certain amount of hype 
\cite{gupta15}; big data has been described as the \textit{new oil} of the 
information age.  The basic task for data scientists, sifting through gargantuan 
volumes of data in search of actionable insights, is highly automated with the 
use of algorithms. Conventional adages such as, \textit{finding the needle in 
a haystack} have been turned on its head, as data scientists are \textit{turning 
hay into needles}, essentially searching for gold in mountains of raw data ore. 
Can the potential of big data may be harnessed for the greater good, to prevent 
disease, to improve health? Seasonal influenza epidemics are a major concern 
for public health, resulting each year in an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 deaths 
worldwide \cite{who17}. This paper explores big data in public health informatics, 
specifically the use of data mining to track epidemics and the spread of contagious 
disease \cite{hay13}. Epidemic spreading is a complex phenomenon, however, based 
on contact networks between individuals and distributed by transportations networks 
\cite{Colizza06}. Limitations of using data mining to predict epidemics are 
discussed. Also considered is how these approaches may be extended to monitor 
the opioid epidemic in North America \cite{volkow14}.


\section{Big Data: Population Health Informatics}

As an ambiguous term, big data lacks a single, unified definition; however, it 
is often described in terms of: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value 
\cite{demchenko12}. The field of Health Informatics is generating huge amounts 
of data at a rapid pace, from MRI imaging data, electronic medical records (EMRs), 
clinical research data, to population-level data. This review focuses on data 
collected at the population level from social media to provide insights about 
epidemics and pandemics  \cite{hay13, herland14}. Trying to track an epidemic in 
real-time from multitudes of incoming web posts (e.g., Twitter), involves a high 
volume of data coming in at high velocity \cite{lamb13, paul14}. In order to be 
of any use, diverse and often messy raw data has to be sifted through and effectively 
organized for further analysis. The issue of Veracity raises the questions of how 
reliable are social media posts for predicting real life events. What is the 
relationship between data mined from social media to biological events such as 
the spreading of disease and contagion? The question of Value evaluates the quality 
of the data obtain in relation to intended outcomes to be attained. There may be 
some question as to the quality of data collected from social media; however, a 
review of the literature suggests that mining information from social media can 
produce data of high value. An important challenge for making sense of big data 
is developing analytic tools adequate to handle large volumes of data in real time.


\subsection{Social Media Data Mining}

Health Informatics research can be considered from two levels: where the data 
is collected, and the research questions being addressed. This paper focuses on 
population level data to address questions about epidemics. Research on social 
media can yield data on a range of issues related to public health, including: 
spatiotemporal information of disease outbreaks, real-time tracking of infectious
diseases, global distributions of various diseases, and search queries on medical 
questions that people might have. The questions of interest in the current review 
are: first, \textit{Can search query data be used to accurately track epidemics in 
a population (in real-time)?};  and second, \textit{Can Twitter post data be used 
to track an epidemic across a population?} A limitation of social media data is 
that, as mentioned above, although it has high Volume, Velocity, and Variety, it 
could be unreliable, resulting in both low Veracity and Value \cite{hay14, lazer14}. 
However, useful data can be extracted through data mining and analytic techniques. 


\subsection{Using Search Query Data to Track Epidemics}

\subsubsection{Tracking Epidemics Using {\itshape Google} Search Terms in U.S.}

Seasonal influenza is an acute viral infection that spreads easily from person to 
person , circulates across the world, affecting people of every age. Traditional 
flu monitoring estimates from the U.S. Center of Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) based on physician reports of patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) are 
released weekly, but generally with a one to two week delay. In an effort to improve 
on early detection of season influenza, a team of researchers developed an automated 
method to analyze Google search queries to track ILI terms from historical logs 
between 2003 and 2008, using 50 million most popular searches, and CDC historical 
data \cite{ginsberg09}. The Google Flu Trends (GFT; https://www.google.org/flutrends) 
model sought to find the probability that a given search query is related to an ILI 
of a patient visiting a physician in the same region. Ginsberg and colleagues used 
a feature selection method to narrow  the 50 million most popular search queries down 
to 45. These top queries showed connections to influenza symptoms, complications, 
remedies, that were consistent with searches by individuals with influenza. The 
researchers based their estimates of the current level of weekly influenza based on 
the correlation of the relative frequency of search queries and the percentage of 
physician visits with patients presenting influenza-like symptoms. Thus, analyzing 
high volume Google search queries was used to predict ILI epidemics in real time for 
areas with a large population of web users, and provide information to the public in 
a matter of days to help physicians and hospitals prepare and respond to the outbreak.

give a couple of examples of display equations in context.

the scope of this sample document, but more information can be found
in the \textit{Author's Guide}, and exhaustive details in the

This article shows only the plainest form of the citation command,

We use jabref to manage all citations. A paper without managing a bib
file will be returned without review. in the bibtex file all urls are
added to rfernces with the {\it url} filed. They are not to be

\section{Conclusions}

This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.  Remember
that you might still have Acknowledgments or Appendices; brief samples
of these follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and we
will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception of the
reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in this paper are to
articles which have nothing to do with the present subject and are
used as examples only \cite{Paul2014}.
