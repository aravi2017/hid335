\section{Introduction}

In the tech era, \textit{Big Data} offers great promise: to fuel innovation, generate new streams of revenue, and ultimately transform society. Along with the potential benefits of big data comes a certain amount of hype \cite{gupta15}; big data has been described as the \textit{new oil} of the information age. The gargantuan task of sifting through inconceivably huge volumes of data is now largely automated with the use of algorithms, yet the task of data scientists essentially involves searching for gold among mountains of ore. Conventional adages such as, \textit{finding the needle in a haystack} are turned on its head, as enterprising data scientists are turning hay into needles. Apart from enriching a handful of corporations or entrepreneurs capable of capitalizing on this tsunami of data, it is important to ask how the potential of big data can be harnessed for the greater good. This paper explores approaches to using big data analytics in the health domain, specifically how data mining of social media behavior has been used to predict the outbreak of epidemics such as influenza and the H1N1 virus \cite{ginsburg09, signorini11, paul14}. Also considered is how this approach could be extended to predict or manage the spread of opioid epidemic in North America \cite{volkow14}.

\section{Big Data: Population Health Informatics}

Despite the tremendous attention focused on big data, it is a somewhat ambiguous terms that lacks a single, unified definition. A useful way to differentiate big data, from small data, is in terms of the following factors: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value \cite{demchenko12}. The field of Health Informatics is generating huge amounts of data at a very rapid pace, from genomic level data, patient tissue samples, imaging data, electronic medical records, up to population-level data. This review focuses on public data collected at the population level from social media that may help provide insights about health concerns such as epidemic spreading and pandemics  \cite{hay13, herland14}. Trying to track an epidemic in real-time from multitudes of incoming web posts (e.g., Twitter), involves a high volume of data coming in at high velocity \cite{lamb13, paul14}. The complex nature of this data reflects the wide variety of information collected, and in order to be of any use, the data has to be sifted through and effectively organized for further analysis.The issues of Veracity raises questions of utmost importance, namely: How reliable are social media posts for predicting real life events? What is the relationship between data mined from social media to biological phenomenon such as the spreading and disease and contagion? The question of Value evaluates the quality of the data obtain in relation to intended outcomes. The may be some question as to the quality of data collected from social media; however, a review of the literature suggests that mining information on social media can produce data of high value.  


\subsection{Social Media Data Mining}

We have already seen several typeface changes in this sample.  You can
indicate italicized words or phrases in your text with the command
\texttt{{\char'134}textit}; emboldening with the command
\texttt{{\char'134}textbf} and typewriter-style (for instance, for
computer code) with \texttt{{\char'134}texttt}.  But remember, you do
not have to indicate typestyle changes when such changes are part of
the \textit{structural} elements of your article; for instance, the
heading of this subsection will be in a sans serif\footnote{Another
  footnote here.  Let's make this a rather long one to see how it
  looks. Footnotes must be avoided.} typeface, but that is handled by
the document class file.  Take care with the use of the curly braces
in typeface changes; they mark the beginning and end of the text that
is to be in the different typeface.

You can use whatever symbols, accented characters, or non-English
characters you need anywhere in your document; you can find a complete
list of what is available in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}
\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

\subsection{Using {\itshape Google} Search Query Data to Track Epidemics}

You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
the three are discussed in the next sections.

\subsubsection{}

A formula that appears in the running text is called an
inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
\textbf{math} environment, which can be
invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end}
construction or with the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You
can use any of the symbols and structures,
from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
this equation:

\begin{math}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{math},

set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsubsection{Display Equations}

A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
\textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just
give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:


\subsection{Using {\itshape Twitter} API Data to Track Epidemics}

Citations to articles~\cite{bowman:reasoning, clark:pct, braams:babel,
  herlihy:methodology}, conference proceedings~\cite{clark:pct} or
maybe books \cite{Lamport:LaTeX, salas:calculus} listed in the
Bibliography section of your article will occur throughout the text of
your article.  You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this
bibliography; you simply need to insert one of several citation
commands with a key of the item cited in the proper location in the
\texttt{.tex} file~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.  The key is a short reference
you invent to uniquely identify each work; in this sample document,
the key is the first author's surname and a word from the title.  This
identifying key is included with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file
for your article.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file are beyond
the scope of this sample document, but more information can be found
in the \textit{Author's Guide}, and exhaustive details in the
\textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide} by Lamport~\shortcite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

This article shows only the plainest form of the citation command,
using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.

Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
\cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
\cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so
Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.), a
chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a divisible
book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as book
\cite{Knuth97}, an article in a proceedings (of a conference,
symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings article)
\cite{Andler79}, a proceedings article with all possible elements
\cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated proceedings article
\cite{VanGundy07}, an informally published work \cite{Harel78}, a
doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85}, a master's thesis:
\cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web resource
\cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game (Case 1)
\cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05} and (Case
3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for publication
\cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author \cite{SaeediMEJ10} and
\cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might contain 'duplicate' DOI and
URLs (some SIAM articles) \cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}.
Boris / Barbara Beeton: multi-volume works as books \cite{MR781536}
and \cite{MR781537}.

A couple of citations with DOIs: \cite{2004:ITE:1009386.1010128,
  Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}.

Online citations: \cite{TUGInstmem, Thornburg01, CTANacmart}.  

We use jabref to manage all citations. A paper without managing a bib
file will be returned without review. in the bibtex file all urls are
added to rfernces with the {\it url} filed. They are not to be
included in the {\it howpublished} or {\it note} field. 


\subsection{Tables}

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
\textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
\textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
this document.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
    \midrule
    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
in the printed output of this document.


\begin{table*}
  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Command &A Number & Comments\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

It is strongly recommended to use the package booktabs~\cite{Fear05}
and follow its main principles of typography with respect to tables:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Never, ever use vertical rules.
\item Never use double rules.
\end{enumerate}

It is also a good idea not to overuse horizontal rules.


\subsection{Figures}

Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the best placement
for them is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest their
initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of
figures, use the environment \textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and
its caption.

This sample document contains examples of \texttt{.eps} files to be
displayable with \LaTeX.  If you work with pdf\LaTeX, use files in the
\texttt{.pdf} format.  Note that most modern \TeX\ systems will convert
\texttt{.eps} to \texttt{.pdf} for you on the fly.  More details on
each of these are found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

\begin{figure}
% \includegraphics{images/fly}
% images not checked in
\caption{A sample black and white graphic.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

% \includegraphics[height=1in, width=1in]{images/fly}

\caption{A sample black and white graphic
that has been resized with the \texttt{includegraphics} command.}
\end{figure}


As was the case with tables, you may want a figure that spans two
columns.  To do this, and still to ensure proper ``floating''
placement of tables, use the environment \textbf{figure*} to enclose
the figure and its caption.  And don't forget to end the environment
with \textbf{figure*}, not \textbf{figure}!

\begin{figure*}
% \includegraphics{images/flies}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic
that needs to span two columns of text.}
\end{figure*}


\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[height=1in, width=1in]{images/rosette}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic that has
been resized with the \texttt{includegraphics} command.}
\end{figure}



\section{Conclusions}

This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.  Remember
that you might still have Acknowledgments or Appendices; brief samples
of these follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and we
will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception of the
reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in this paper are to
articles which have nothing to do with the present subject and are
used as examples only \cite{Paul2014}.



\appendix

%Appendix A
\section{Headings in Appendices}

The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for the body of
the article are different in the appendices.  In the \textbf{appendix}
environment, the command \textbf{section} is used to indicate the
start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order designation (i.e., the
first is A, the second B, etc.) and a title (if you include one).  So,
if you need hierarchical structure \textit{within} an Appendix, start
with \textbf{subsection} as the highest level. Here is an outline of
the body of this document in Appendix-appropriate form:
