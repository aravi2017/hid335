\section{Introduction}

In the tech era, \textit{Big Data} offers great promises, to fuel innovation, generate new streams of revenue, and ultimately transform society. Along with heightened expectations about the numerous benefits of big data comes a certain amount of hype \cite{gupta15}; big data has been described as the \textit{new oil} of the information age. The gargantuan task of sifting through inconceivably huge volumes of data is now largely automated with the use of algorithms, yet the task of data scientists essentially involves searching for gold among mountains of ore. Conventional adages such as, \textit{finding the needle in a haystack} are turned on its head, as enterprising data scientists are turning hay into needles. Apart from enriching a handful of corporations or tech entrepreneurs capable of capitalizing on this data tsunami, an important to consider is how the potential of big data may be harnessed for the greater good. This paper explores approaches to using big data analytics in the health domain, specifically examining how data mining of social media has been used to track the spread of infectious disease and outbreak of epidemics \cite{hay13}. I also consider how these approaches may be extended to monitor the opioid epidemic in North America \cite{volkow14}.

\section{Big Data: Population Health Informatics}

Big data is an ambiguous term that lacks a single, unified definition; a useful approach has been to define big data in terms of: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value \cite{demchenko12}. The field of Health Informatics is generating huge amounts of data at a very rapid pace, from genomic data, patient tissue samples, MRI imaging data, electronic medical records (EMRs), clinical research data, up to population-level data. This review focuses on public data collected at the population level from social media that may provide insights about health concerns such as epidemic spreading and pandemics  \cite{hay13, herland14}. Trying to track an epidemic in real-time from multitudes of incoming web posts (e.g., Twitter), involves a high volume of data coming in at high velocity \cite{lamb13, paul14}. The complex nature of this data reflects the wide variety of information collected, and in order to be of any use, the data has to be sifted through and effectively organized for further analysis.The issue of Veracity raises questions of utmost importance: How reliable are social media posts for predicting real life events? What is the relationship between data mined from social media to biological phenomenon such as the spreading and disease and contagion? The question of Value evaluates the quality of the data obtain in relation to intended outcomes to be attained. There may be some question as to the quality of data collected from social media; however, a review of the literature suggests that mining information from social media can produce data of high value. An important challenge for making sense of big data is developing data mining and analytic methods to handle large volumes of rapidly growing data. 


\subsection{Social Media Data Mining}

Health Informatics research can be considered from two levels: where the data is collected, and the research questions being addressed. This paper focuses on population level data to address questions about epidemics. Research on social media can yield data on a range of issues related to public health, including: spatiotemporal information of disease outbreaks, real-time tracking of infectious diseases, global distributions of various diseases, and search queries on medical questions that people might have. The questions of interest in the current review are: first, \textit{Can search query data be used to accurately track epidemics in a population (in real-time)?};  and second, \textit{Can Twitter post data be used to track an epidemic across a population?} A limitation of social media data is that, as mentioned above, although it has high Volume, Velocity, and Variety, it could be unreliable, resulting in both low Veracity and Value \cite{hay14, lazer14}. However, useful data can be extracted through data mining and analytic techniques. 


\subsection{Using Search Query Data to Track Epidemics}

Seasonal influenza is an acute viral infection that spreads easily from person to person , circulates across the world, affecting people of every age. Worldwide, seasonal influenza epidemics are a major public health concern, resulting in an estimated 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths each year \cite{who16}. In the U.S., traditional flu monitoring estimates from the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) based on physician reports of patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) are released weekly, but generally with a one to two week delay.

\subsubsection{Tracking Epidemics Using {\itshape Google} Search Terms in U.S.}

A team of researchers developed an automated method to analyze Google search queries to track ILI terms from historical logs between 2003 and 2008, using 50 million most popular searches, and CDC historical data \cite{ginsberg09}. The Google Flu Trends (GFT) model sought to find the probability that a given search query is related to an ILI of a patient visiting a physician in the same region. Ginsberg and colleagues used a feature selection method to narrow down the 50 million most popular search queries to 45. The top queries showed connections to influenza symptoms, complications, remedies, that werew presumably consistent with searches by individuals with influenza. This method of analyzing high volume of Google search queries was designed to predict development of ILI epidemics in areas with a large population of web users, and provide information to the public in a matter of days rather than weeks. Ultimately, the project sought to provide actionable information about ILI epidemics in real time to help physicians and hospital prepare to stop the spread of the disease. Despite the impressive correlations, 
how accurate was the prediction provided by GFT?

give a couple of examples of display equations in context.

the scope of this sample document, but more information can be found
in the \textit{Author's Guide}, and exhaustive details in the
\textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide} by Lamport~\shortcite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

This article shows only the plainest form of the citation command,
using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.

We use jabref to manage all citations. A paper without managing a bib
file will be returned without review. in the bibtex file all urls are
added to rfernces with the {\it url} filed. They are not to be
included in the {\it howpublished} or {\it note} field. 



\section{Conclusions}

This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.  Remember
that you might still have Acknowledgments or Appendices; brief samples
of these follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and we
will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception of the
reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in this paper are to
articles which have nothing to do with the present subject and are
used as examples only \cite{Paul2014}.
