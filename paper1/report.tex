\section{Introduction}

In the tech era, \textit{Big Data} offers great promises, to fuel innovation, generate new streams of revenue, and ultimately transform society. Along with heightened expectations about the numerous benefits of big data comes a certain amount of hype \cite{gupta15}; big data has been described as the \textit{new oil} of the information age. The gargantuan task of sifting through inconceivably huge volumes of data is now largely automated with the use of algorithms, yet the task of data scientists essentially involves searching for gold among mountains of ore. Conventional adages such as, \textit{finding the needle in a haystack} are turned on its head, as enterprising data scientists are turning hay into needles. Apart from enriching a handful of corporations or tech entrepreneurs capable of capitalizing on this data tsunami, an important to consider is how the potential of big data may be harnessed for the greater good. This paper explores approaches to using big data analytics in the health domain, specifically how data mining of social media behavior has been used to predict the outbreak of epidemics such as influenza and the H1N1 virus \cite{signorini11,yuan13}. Also considered is how this approach could be extended to predict or manage the spread of opioid epidemic in North America \cite{volkow14}.

\section{Big Data: Population Health Informatics}

Big data is an ambiguous term that lacks a single, unified definition; a useful approach has been to define big data in terms of: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value \cite{demchenko12}. The field of Health Informatics is generating huge amounts of data at a very rapid pace, from genomic data, patient tissue samples, MRI imaging data, electronic medical records (EMRs), clinical research data, up to population-level data. This review focuses on public data collected at the population level from social media that may provide insights about health concerns such as epidemic spreading and pandemics  \cite{hay13, herland14}. Trying to track an epidemic in real-time from multitudes of incoming web posts (e.g., Twitter), involves a high volume of data coming in at high velocity \cite{lamb13, paul14}. The complex nature of this data reflects the wide variety of information collected, and in order to be of any use, the data has to be sifted through and effectively organized for further analysis.The issue of Veracity raises questions of utmost importance: How reliable are social media posts for predicting real life events? What is the relationship between data mined from social media to biological phenomenon such as the spreading and disease and contagion? The question of Value evaluates the quality of the data obtain in relation to intended outcomes to be attained. There may be some question as to the quality of data collected from social media; however, a review of the literature suggests that mining information from social media can produce data of high value. An important challenge for making sense of big data is developing data mining and analytic methods to handle large volumes of rapidly growing data. 


\subsection{Social Media Data Mining}

Health Informatics research can be considered from two levels: where the data is collected, and the research questions being addressed. This paper focuses on population level data to address questions about epidemics.  Research on social media can yield data on a range of issues related to public health, including: spatiotemporal information of disease outbreaks, real-time tracking of infectious diseases, global distributions of various diseases, and search queries on medical questions that people might have. The questions of interest in the current review are: first, \textit{Can search query data be used to accurately track epidemics in a population (in real-time)?};  and second, \textit{Can Twitter post data be used to track an epidemic across a population?} A limitation of social media data is that, as mentioned above, although it has high Volume, Velocity, and Variety, it could be unreliable, resulting in both low Veracity and Value \cite{hay14, lazer14}. However, useful data can be extracted through data mining and analytic techniques. 


\subsection{Using Search Query Data to Track Epidemics}

You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
the three are discussed in the next sections.

\subsubsection{Tracking Epidemics Using {\itshape Google} Search Terms in U.S.}

A formula that appears in the running text is called an
inline or in-text formula.  


\subsubsection{Tracking H1N1 Epidemic Using Search Queries on {\itshape Baidu} in China }

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just
give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:


\subsection{Using {\itshape Twitter} API Data to Track Epidemics}

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file are beyond
the scope of this sample document, but more information can be found
in the \textit{Author's Guide}, and exhaustive details in the
\textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide} by Lamport~\shortcite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

This article shows only the plainest form of the citation command,
using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.

Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
\cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
\cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so
Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.), a
chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a divisible
book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as book
\cite{Knuth97}, an article in a proceedings (of a conference,
symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings article)
\cite{Andler79}, a proceedings article with all possible elements
\cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated proceedings article
\cite{VanGundy07}, an informally published work \cite{Harel78}, a
doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85}, a master's thesis:
\cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web resource
\cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game (Case 1)
\cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05} and (Case
3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for publication
\cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author \cite{SaeediMEJ10} and
\cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might contain 'duplicate' DOI and
URLs (some SIAM articles) \cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}.
Boris / Barbara Beeton: multi-volume works as books \cite{MR781536}
and \cite{MR781537}.

A couple of citations with DOIs: \cite{2004:ITE:1009386.1010128,
  Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}.

Online citations: \cite{TUGInstmem, Thornburg01, CTANacmart}.  

We use jabref to manage all citations. A paper without managing a bib
file will be returned without review. in the bibtex file all urls are
added to rfernces with the {\it url} filed. They are not to be
included in the {\it howpublished} or {\it note} field. 


\subsection{Tables}

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
\textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
\textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
this document.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
    \midrule
    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
in the printed output of this document.


\begin{table*}
  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Command &A Number & Comments\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

It is strongly recommended to use the package booktabs~\cite{Fear05}
and follow its main principles of typography with respect to tables:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Never, ever use vertical rules.
\item Never use double rules.
\end{enumerate}

It is also a good idea not to overuse horizontal rules.


\subsection{Figures}

Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the best placement
for them is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest their
initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of
figures, use the environment \textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and
its caption.

This sample document contains examples of \texttt{.eps} files to be
displayable with \LaTeX.  If you work with pdf\LaTeX, use files in the
\texttt{.pdf} format.  Note that most modern \TeX\ systems will convert
\texttt{.eps} to \texttt{.pdf} for you on the fly.  More details on
each of these are found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

\begin{figure}
% \includegraphics{images/fly}
% images not checked in
\caption{A sample black and white graphic.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

% \includegraphics[height=1in, width=1in]{images/fly}

\caption{A sample black and white graphic
that has been resized with the \texttt{includegraphics} command.}
\end{figure}


As was the case with tables, you may want a figure that spans two
columns.  To do this, and still to ensure proper ``floating''
placement of tables, use the environment \textbf{figure*} to enclose
the figure and its caption.  And don't forget to end the environment
with \textbf{figure*}, not \textbf{figure}!

\begin{figure*}
% \includegraphics{images/flies}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic
that needs to span two columns of text.}
\end{figure*}


\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[height=1in, width=1in]{images/rosette}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic that has
been resized with the \texttt{includegraphics} command.}
\end{figure}



\section{Conclusions}

This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.  Remember
that you might still have Acknowledgments or Appendices; brief samples
of these follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and we
will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception of the
reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in this paper are to
articles which have nothing to do with the present subject and are
used as examples only \cite{Paul2014}.



\appendix

%Appendix A
\section{Headings in Appendices}

The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for the body of
the article are different in the appendices.  In the \textbf{appendix}
environment, the command \textbf{section} is used to indicate the
start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order designation (i.e., the
first is A, the second B, etc.) and a title (if you include one).  So,
if you need hierarchical structure \textit{within} an Appendix, start
with \textbf{subsection} as the highest level. Here is an outline of
the body of this document in Appendix-appropriate form:

\subsection{Introduction}
\subsection{The Body of the Paper}
\subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
\subsubsection{Math Equations}
\paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
\paragraph{Display Equations}
