## What the paper should be about: 
* Review research paper with the same sections. only fact-finding, no programming necessarily
* Answer questions like these in the paper:
  * Why is this topic important?
  * How it's relevant to big data?
* Minimum length: 2 pages (excluding images, tables, ...)
 
Use the templates on the class web.
* LATEX is preferred.
* Use Jabref for referencing.
  * entry type (discussion on what some types mean)
  * article vs proceedings vs PhDThesis. Read about them online.
  * Proceedings: All papers of a conference go to a book.
  * Any other web page=> Misc
  * Conference: conference without any proceedings
* View tutorial for Jabref.
* Bibtex key is the keyword that you use in the main text to refer to the corresponding bibtex entry. For bibtex key, jabref may automatically create it. But you can replace it with something else. You can come up with your own system for bibtex keys e.g. [lastname][year][topic] for it so that you remember.
 
Look at laszewski.github.io for examples of referencing.

Some online resources such as google scholar generate bibtex entries. Some of them such as wikipedia may do it incorrectly.
* Author = {{Amazon Inc.}}  => This will appear intact, while:
* {Amazon Inc.} will appear like A. Inc
